Since I didn't have android studio in my system it took quite a bit of time to install and set up the environment properly.

As a result I could only do the 1st page in the allotted time. 

I mentioned some improvements as comments which could have been done but I wasn't able to finish due to time constraints.

For the 2nd page for info display, the individual list views should have on click listeners which will send the movie object to the 2nd page
The 2nd page will display the data using the object data it got in intent.

There could have been loaders when loading more data and image content.


Since I do not have a physical device to test, I tested on the AVD itself so I am not sure about the scroll performance. In my AVD, it seemed slow, it could be due to laptop handling touchscreen input, but there could be some other issue.


For the list items, I simply added them back to back. There should have been some proper functionality to handle large data. It could have been handled asynchronously as well.

Thank You,
